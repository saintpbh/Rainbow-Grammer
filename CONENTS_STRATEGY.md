# Rainbow Grammar Content Evolutionary Strategy

## 1. Goal: From "Structure Recognition" to "Natural Output"
The primary goal is for students to internalize the 1-5 sentence patterns so they can produce them instinctively in real-time communication.

## 2. Pedagogical Framework: The 3 Pillars

### A. Sensory Integration (Visual + Audio)
- Use strong color-coding (S: Red, V: Orange, O: Green, C: Blue, M: Gray) to create a "Visual Syntax" map in the brain.
- **Action**: TTS should not just play text, but highlight the corresponding color-coded word in the UI simultaneously.

### B. High-Frequency Pattern Flooding
- Instead of random sentences, use sets of sentences that share the same structure but different vocabularies.
- **Action**: Re-organize data files into "Pattern Clusters" (e.g., 20 sentences for 4th format using direct/indirect objects).

### C. Situational Output (Situation -> Structure)
- Shift from "Translate this Korean sentence" to "Respond to this situation."
- **Action**: Add a `situation` field to JSON data to provide context before the English construction begins.

## 3. Practical Training Techniques (Game Mechanics)

### Step 1: Pattern Mimicry (Level 0-1)
- Focus on accuracy and recognizing the color-logic.
- 3x Audio loop is critical here for prosody and stress recognition.

### Step 2: Speed Retrieval (Level 2-4)
- Introduce a "Speed Bonus" or "Time Attack."
- Users must choose the correct verb form or object within 3 seconds to get "Fire" points.

### Step 3: Structural Fluency (Level 5-6)
- Remove some visual color hints gradually.
- Ask the user to "Rearrange the sequence" of mixed phrases (Chunks) rather than single words.

## 4. Content Update Roadmap
1. **Week 1-2**: 1st & 2nd Patterns (Identity and State)
2. **Week 3-4**: 3rd & 4th Patterns (Transaction and Influence)
3. **Week 5-8**: 5th Pattern (Complex Relationships) - Focus on `make`, `call`, `find`, `let` verbs.
4. **Beyond**: Moving to Tense and Voice variations within these 5 patterns.
